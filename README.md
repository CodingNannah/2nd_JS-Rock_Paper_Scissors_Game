This is a Computer vs. Computer "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, which I created after practicing Dave Gray's JS Tutorial for Beginners #1 through #8.
___________________________________
To Run This Game in Windows:
1. Download these files and open them in VSC with the Live Server extension
2. Open a Chrome Browser (about:blank)
3. Use ctrl + shift + J to open the console
4. Click on "Go Live" at the bottom of VSC
5. The first game will automatically display in the console.
6. To "play" again, refresh the browser.

Game Creation Notes:
My First JS Rock, Paper, Scissors Game used simple IF statements. My Second JS Rock, Paper, Scissors Game uses Switch statements.

I borrowed my code from the last game to use optionA and optionB here for randomizing results. This time, I did not include the results for the Player and the Computer to add them to the win or tie message.
